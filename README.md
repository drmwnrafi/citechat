CiteChat is an research assistant web app designed to simplify the academic journey. By turning PDF documents into a treasure trove of knowledge. CiteChat functions as a chatbot, researchers simply upload a PDF and ask questions about the PDF. CiteChat by default, uses internet-connected BARD or locally (optional) run LLAMA-2 to get responses. With CiteChat, I hope your research becomes more accessible and efficient than ever before.
